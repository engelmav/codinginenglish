# Student A reads to student B:

This is by far the best pizza place in town. One of the problems I have though is that I can't read the text on the menu. It's all too ___ (squished together)! I'm not sure what it's called, but they need to add some padding I think, so that here's some ____ (space) around the text. Maybe then I'd come to the restaurant more often, if I could actually read the menu!
