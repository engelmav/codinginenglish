Like other people have said in the reviews, there is a lot of great food at Anna's Pizza Shop, but what happened to their menu? Usually when I come in, I have to do the math to figure out what the price is after tax. What is that called? Oh yeah, net or total cost. Anyway, why don't they just add the last column in the menu? You know, the part that goes under the "Total" heading. Tables are easy. We've been using tables for years for menus and lists of all kinds! What's up with Anna's menu?!
