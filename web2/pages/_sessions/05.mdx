# Lesson 05 - Student Guide

## Loops and Food Menus

Welcome to Lesson 5 of Coding in English! Let's review what we did. Then, let's make sure it's done, so we can move the ticket to the Done column!

<AccordionPanel title="[01] Lesson 04 Review">

- squiggly bracket
- quotes
- their
- Is the customer always right?

</AccordionPanel>

### REVIEW IS OVER!! Let's carry on to the new stuff...

<AccordionPanel title="[02.01] Before we listen to a Voicemail from Anna...">
  Let's get familiar with some vocabulary before we listen to Anna's voicemail.
  <FillInBlanks
    questionAnswer={[
      {
        question: "When you walk _________, you can crash into a wall!",
        answer: "backwards",
      },
      {
        question:
          "The CSS property that changes the _________ color is `background-color`.",
        answer: "background",
      },
      {
        question:
          "It's common to use a _________ font style when something is important.",
        answer: "bold",
      },
      {
        question:
          "We say ____ __ to express necessity, that we need to do something. For example, I _____ __ eat in order to live!.",
        answer: "have to",
      },
      {
        question:
          "The ________ on a menu are all the options that a customer can pick from.",
        answer: "items",
      },
    ]}
  />
</AccordionPanel>

<AccordionPanel title="[02.02]  Anna left us a VM">

Anna has left us a voice mail. Let's listen to it and see if we can use our previous exercise to help understand.

---

> Hello Coding in English! I am grateful for the UI you created to give our customers their order summary.
> I realize I might be thinking a little backwards but I think the next step for us is to let customers to be able to choose from a menu.
> Is that something you can do? I hope so! If so, I have some common items I'd like to try out, sort of like an MVP.
> Also I'm not sure how I want my menu items styled. I was thinking we make them a bold font with lines under each one. Or maybe black with a gray background. Let me know which way you decide to go.
> I also want to make it so that I can add my own items to the menu, because sometimes I have to add and remove things. Thanks.

- Is Anna asking for one thing or two things?
- Which do you think might be easier - showing a list, or making an editable list?
- Anna is giving us a choice about something. What is it?

## Next...

<AccordionPanel title="[03] Handling Anna's Requirement">
  How can we make a ticket to capture what Anna wants for her platform?



Click [here](https://codinginenglish.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/APS/boards/1) to go to Coding in English JIRA.



We want to use the Story structure that we used in our last JIRA ticket. This is called "Story Structure"

> 

> AS a `<Customer|Restaurant Owner|>`

> I WANT to see all the items the pizzeria has for sale

> SO THAT I can choose what I want to buy


</AccordionPanel>

Something we need to know in order to actually do what Anna wants...

<AccordionPanel title="[04] What is a loop (or map) and how does it work?">

<img
  style={{ width: "200px", height: "auto" }}
  src="https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/FEosQGkds8y5.png?o=1"
/>

Some questions to consider.

- Does this picture show something happening repeatedly, or once?
- What shape do you think of when you hear the word "loop"?
- If you were to get up and "walk in a loop", what would that look like? Let's try it.

## HERE IS A LOOP!
