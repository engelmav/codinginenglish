# Session 06 - Student Guide

## Working well, 

[Anna's Pizza Shop JIRA](https://codinginenglish.atlassian.net/jira/your-work)

Welcome to Lesson 6 of Coding in English! Let's review what we did. Then, let's make sure it's done, so we can move the ticket to the Done column!

<AccordionPanel title="[00] TODO: Warm up">

- As a customer I want to see all the items the pizzeria has for sale ________ I can choose what I want to buy
- Anna wanted an _______ menu, because sometimes she has to add or remove things.
- You can _______________ through a list of menu items in order to display them in ReactJS. 
- A _______ helps CSS locate what element you want to style.


</AccordionPanel>

<AccordionPanel title="[02] Push back on Anna">

Let's push back on Anna. Sometimes our clients ask a little too much up front and we have to figure out how to split out the work
and provide them with useful increments.

Let's confirm that our ticket is complete, and send Anna an email.

How can we write that email?

Later we can record this as a voice memo.

Let's look at Anna's email again.

> Hello Coding in English! I am grateful for the UI you created to give our customers their order summary.
> I realize I might be thinking a little backwards but I think the next step for us is to let customers to be able to choose from a menu.

> Is that something you can do? I hope so! If so, I have some common items I'd like to try out, sort of like an MVP.

> Also I'm not sure how I want my menu items styled. I was thinking we make them a bold font with lines under each one.
> Or maybe black with a gray background. Let me know which way you decide to go.

> I also want to make it so that I can add my own items to the menu, because sometimes I have to add and remove things.


> Thanks!


Let's tell Anna this. Hey Anna, in order to edit the menu, I think you would also want to edit the price, right?
Don't worry, we won't forget about the editing. We'll write a ticket and put it in the backlog. We'll look at
it next sprint.
Let me just give you a rough sketch of the price first so that we don't have to go too nuts with the editing.

<AccordionPanel title="[02] In order to add prices, we need to talk about lists and objects">


A list in JavaScript

```
const menuItems = ["pizza", "soda", "calzones"]
```

</AccordionPanel>




<AccordionPanel title="[01] Lesson 05 Review">

- As a customer I want to see all the items the pizzeria has for sale ________ I can choose what I want to buy
- Anna wanted an _______ menu, because sometimes she has to add or remove things.
- You can _______________ through a list of menu items in order to display them in ReactJS. 
- A _______ helps CSS locate what element you want to style.

<AccordionPanel title="[02.01] Before we listen to a Voicemail from Anna...">
  Let's get familiar with some vocabulary before we listen to Anna's voicemail.
  <FillInBlanks
    questionAnswer={[
      {
        question: "When you walk _________, you can crash into a wall!",
        answer: "backwards",
      },
      {
        question:
          "The CSS property that changes the _________ color is `background-color`.",
        answer: "background",
      },
      {
        question:
          "It's common to use a _________ font style when something is important.",
        answer: "bold",
      },
      {
        question:
          "We say ____ __ to express necessity, that we need to do something. For example, I _____ __ eat in order to live!.",
        answer: "have to",
      },
      {
        question:
          "The ________ on a menu are all the options that a customer can pick from.",
        answer: "items",
      },
    ]}
  />
</AccordionPanel>

<AccordionPanel title="[02.02]  Anna left us a VM">

Anna has left us a voice mail. Let's listen to it and see if we can use our previous exercise to help understand.

- Is Anna asking for one thing or two things?
- Which do you think might be easier - showing a list, or making an editable list?
- Anna is giving us a choice about something. What is it?

<AccordionPanel title="[03] Handling Anna's Requirement">
  How can we make a ticket to capture what Anna wants for her platform?

We want to use the Story structure that we used in our last JIRA ticket. This is called "Story Structure"

> 

> AS a `<Customer|Restaurant Owner|>`

> I WANT to see all the items the pizzeria has for sale

> SO THAT I can choose what I want to buy


</AccordionPanel>

Something we need to know in order to actually do what Anna wants...

<AccordionPanel title="[04] What is a loop (or map) and how does it work?">

<img
  style={{ width: "200px", height: "auto" }}
  src="https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/FEosQGkds8y5.png?o=1"
/>

Some questions to consider.

- Does this picture show something happening repeatedly, or once?
- What shape do you think of when you hear the word "loop"?
- If you were to get up and "walk in a loop", what would that look like? Let's try it.

## HERE IS A LOOP!
