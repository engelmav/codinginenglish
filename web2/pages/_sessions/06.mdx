# Session 06 - Student Guide

## Working well,

[Anna's Pizza Shop JIRA](https://codinginenglish.atlassian.net/jira/your-work)

Welcome to Lesson 6 of Coding in English! Let's review what we did. Then, let's make sure it's done, so we can move the ticket to the Done column!

<AccordionPanel title="[00] Warm up: Love or Hate">

The teacher will say a few words or ideas. You can put them in either of two categories: Love or hate.

In your notes, make two columns. One column is "love", the other "hate".

Then the teacher will say them!

After the teacher says them, explain why you love or hate these things.

<AccordionPanel title="[01] Taking a look at Anna's original email">

> Hello Coding in English! I am grateful for the UI you created to give our customers their order summary.
> I realize I might be thinking a little backwards but I think the next step for us is to let customers to be able to choose from a menu.
> Is that something you can do? I hope so! If so, I have some common items I'd like to try out, sort of like an MVP.
> Also I'm not sure how I want my menu items styled. I was thinking we make them a bold font with lines under each one. Or maybe black with a gray background. Let me know which way you decide to go.
> I also want to make it so that I can add my own items to the menu, because sometimes I have to add and remove things. Thanks.

</AccordionPanel>

<AccordionPanel title="[02] Push back on Anna">

Let's push back on Anna. Sometimes our clients ask a little too much up front and we have to figure out how to split out the work
and provide them with useful increments.

Let's confirm that our ticket is complete, and send Anna an email.

How can we write that email?

Later we can record this as a voice memo.

Let's look at Anna's email again.

> Hello Coding in English! I am grateful for the UI you created to give our customers their order summary.

Let's push back in email.

<AccordionPanel title="[03] Objects: Add some new objects">

Now, you are creating a table. Use these fruits to add to an existing table.

<Table
  data={[

    { name: "grapefruit", glycemicIndex: 25 },
    { name: "apricot", glycemicIndex: "34" },
