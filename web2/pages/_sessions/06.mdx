# Session 06 - Student Guide

## Working well,

[Anna's Pizza Shop JIRA](https://codinginenglish.atlassian.net/jira/your-work)

Welcome to Lesson 6 of Coding in English! Let's review what we did. Then, let's make sure it's done, so we can move the ticket to the Done column!

<AccordionPanel title="[00] TODO: Warm up">

- As a customer I want to see all the items the pizzeria has for sale **\_\_\_\_** I can choose what I want to buy
- Anna wanted an **\_\_\_** menu, because sometimes she has to add or remove things.
- You can **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** through a list of menu items in order to display them in ReactJS.
- A **\_\_\_** helps CSS locate what element you want to style.

</AccordionPanel>

<AccordionPanel title="[02] Push back on Anna">

Let's push back on Anna. Sometimes our clients ask a little too much up front and we have to figure out how to split out the work
and provide them with useful increments.

Let's confirm that our ticket is complete, and send Anna an email.

How can we write that email?

Later we can record this as a voice memo.

Let's look at Anna's email again.

> Hello Coding in English! I am grateful for the UI you created to give our customers their order summary.
> I realize I might be thinking a little backwards but I think the next step for us is to let customers to be able to choose from a menu.

> Is that something you can do? I hope so! If so, I have some common items I'd like to try out, sort of like an MVP.

> Also I'm not sure how I want my menu items styled. I was thinking we make them a bold font with lines under each one.
> Or maybe black with a gray background. Let me know which way you decide to go.

> I also want to make it so that I can add my own items to the menu, because sometimes I have to add and remove things.

> Thanks!

Let's tell Anna this. Hey Anna, in order to edit the menu, I think you would also want to edit the price, right?
Don't worry, we won't forget about the editing. We'll write a ticket and put it in the backlog. We'll look at
it next sprint.
Let me just give you a rough sketch of the price first so that we don't have to go too nuts with the editing.

</AccordionPanel>

<AccordionPanel title="[02] In order to add prices, we need to talk about lists and objects">

A list in JavaScript

```
const menuItems = ["pizza", "soda", "calzones"]
```

what would this do?
menuItems[0]

how about this?

menuItems[1]

Let's try it! Press Control-Shift-I in your browser window and enter this:

```
const menuItems = ["pizza", "soda", "calzones"]
```

</AccordionPanel>
