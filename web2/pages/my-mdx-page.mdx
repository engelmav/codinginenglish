# Lesson 05 - Student Guide
## Loops and Food Menus

Welcome to Lesson 5 of Coding in English! Let's review what we did. Then, let's make sure it's done, so we can move the ticket to the Done column!

### REVIEW IS OVER!!!! Let's carry on to the new stuff...





<AccordionPanel title="[02]  Anna left us a VM">

  Anna has left us a voice mail. Let's listen to it and see if we can use our previous exercise to help understand.

  ---

  > Hello Coding in English! I am grateful for the UI you created to give our customers their order summary.
  > I realized I might be thinking a little backwards but now I realize it's important for customers to be able to choose from a menu.
  > Is that something you can do? I hope so! If so, I have some common items I'd like to try out, sort of like an MVP.
  > i also want to make it so that I can add my own items to the menu, because I have I sometimes add and remove things.



  Whoaaa there Anna, hold your horses!!! We aren't doing all of your shit right away.

Something we need to know in order to actually do what Anna wants...


<AccordionPanel title="[04] What the hell is a for loop, or map, and how does it work?">

<img style={{width: "200px", height: "auto" }} src="https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/FEosQGkds8y5.png?o=1"/>

Let's consider some words:

* dot (.)
* parenthesis
* loop

Some questions to consider.

* Does this picture show something happening repeatedly, or once?
* What shape do you think of when you hear the word "loop"?
* If you were to get up and "walk in a loop", what would that look like? Let's try it.

## HERE IS A LOOP!!!
